                heart conditions. It consists of a balloon that is inserted into the aorta and inflates and deflates in sync
                with the cardiac cycle. This action helps to increase blood flow to the coronary arteries and reduce the
                workload on the heart, improving oxygen delivery to vital organs. The IABP is particularly beneficial for
                patients experiencing cardiogenic shock or undergoing high-risk cardiac procedures, providing critical
